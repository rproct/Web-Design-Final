# Web-Design-Final

**Description**: The purpose of this project is to update/fix a website that needs fixing to streamline and fix any UI/UX problems that could possibly affect user experience and usablity.

## UPDATE
The project was initially built with Node.js, Express.js, EJS, and Bootstrap 4 while hosted on Heroku. Due to changes to Heroku's pricing policies and changing web technologies, the project needed to be updated to support these new technologies thus providing additional security while migrating to Netlify. The overall website should *look* and function the same with emphasis on the **look**, since this is a UX project instead of a web programming project. The project know uses Astro for the frontend instead of Express and EJS, while updated to use Node.js LTS 18.* and Bootstrap 5. I reiterate, the frontend is the same, the code behind it is mostly different.
