    While the Covid-19 virus is still an immediate threat, Legal Services for
    Seniors has suspended our in-person outreach sessions. We are anxious to get
    back to serving the community as soon as it is safe and healthy for us all.
    In the meantime, please give us a call at 831.899.0492 or 831.442.7700 to
    talk with an advocate about your legal issue.
